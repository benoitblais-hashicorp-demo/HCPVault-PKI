# Vault PKI Demo



## What This Demo Demonstrates



## Demo Components


## Permissions

### Vault



## Authentication

Authentication to Vault can be configured using one of the following methods:

### Static Token

Use environment variables to authenticate with a static Vault token:

- `VAULT_ADDR`: Set to your HCP Vault Dedicated cluster address (e.g., `https://my-cluster.vault.hashicorp.cloud:8200`).
- `VAULT_TOKEN`: Set to a valid Vault token with the permissions listed above.
- `VAULT_NAMESPACE`: Set to the parent namespace (e.g., `admin`) if applicable.

### HCP Terraform Dynamic Credentials (Recommended)

For enhanced security, use HCP Terraform's dynamic provider credentials to authenticate to Vault without storing static tokens.
This method uses workload identity (JWT/OIDC) to generate short-lived Vault tokens automatically.

- `TFC_VAULT_PROVIDER_AUTH`: Set to `true`.
- `TFC_VAULT_ADDR`: Set to your HCP Vault Dedicated cluster address.
- `TFC_VAULT_NAMESPACE`: Set to the parent namespace.
- `TFC_VAULT_RUN_ROLE`: Set to the JWT role name configured in Vault.
